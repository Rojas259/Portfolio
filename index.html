            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>Welcome to my web development portfolio! I am currently enrolled in the ASU Coding Bootcamp.<br><br>

                I am experiences training other people in hands on work for factory workplace and managing inventory for
                product through remote servers to be log in location updates and E-Mail others to order items for the floor.
                I have also trained others on setting up pumps for pods on the floor as well as any maintenance on them as well. 
                I was trained in use on the Swing-Reach and Dock Stocker. I also trained other on forklifts as well. I've had also 
                helped make SOP's(Standard Operating Procedures) to the Filling Department to be able to have on file to in documents 
                for training and safety updates for processing. I take part in safety meetings to represent my shift and department
                to raise concerns for things that need to be repaired or look at for safety reasons. I trained in medical aid if someone
                was injured on the floor.</form><br><br>

                Before working at this job I was working on my Associates in Science and continue working on my Biotechnology. 
                I was working for 40 to 60 hours a week for work and have class in the afternoons. So, I have experience in working long
                hours and maintain class work at the sametime. I have also have done community service and help in my religion for programs
                with Junior Youth and youth programs and projects in my free time. I would read mangas and books for genes of science 
                fiction, Fantasy, and mostly afterlife/purgatory stories. I also would draw things that would pop up in my head at the time.
                I would play Video games in my free time to relax after a long week of work and school, if was not going out my friends to
                play basketball or football.<br><br>

                I was always intested in learning more in technology since I was in highschool when I got my first android phone and i was 
                learning how VPN's work and what the hardware/software was in the phone. While was in college I got my first IPhone and I had 
                relearn how to use the ios system. I even got my first laptop, but I had not expereince in buying a Laptop so I had bought a 
                terrible laptop that costed me $500 and it got ghost keysafter a year of use. I had to buy a new laptop and I had to do research
                after a lot research to buy a gaming laptop that was $1,200. After researching and watching videos on building and buying the 
                right computer for your neads.<br><br>
